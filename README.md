# C# Bootcamp Projects 👩‍💻

This repository contains eight projects I completed during the C# Bootcamp led by Murat Yücedağ. Each project was carefully designed to enhance my understanding of programming concepts and improve my coding skills. Below is an overview of each project with key technical details:

### 🟣 Project 1: Hello World!
In this introductory project, I learned to print messages to the console using `Console.WriteLine()`. This helped me understand basic C# syntax and structure. 🖥️

### 🟣 Project 2: Variables
Here, I experimented with different data types (`int`, `string`, `double`) and practiced defining and manipulating variables. This was a great way to deepen my understanding of data types. 🔢

### 🟣 Project 3: Arrays
I explored arrays and learned how to store and manage multiple values in a structured format. Using loops, I accessed and manipulated data within arrays efficiently. 📈

### 🟣 Project 4: Conditional Statements
Using `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements, I implemented decision-making within the program. This project introduced me to building logic that responds to varying conditions. ⚙️

### 🟣 Project 5: Loops
With `for`, `while`, and `foreach` loops, I automated repetitive tasks and improved data processing. Working with loops allowed me to efficiently handle larger data sets. 🔄

### 🟣 Project 6: Methods
In this project, I focused on structuring code with methods to make it more organized and reusable. I practiced writing methods that take parameters, perform actions, and return results. 🧩

### 🟣 Project 7: Foreach Loop & Exam System
This project involved creating a simple exam system simulation. I used `foreach` loops to calculate students’ average scores and determine pass/fail outcomes based on their grades. 📝

### 🟣 Project 8: Functions with Return Values
In the final project, I worked with functions that return values, allowing me to process user inputs and generate results. This project helped me tackle more complex programming tasks and improved my problem-solving skills. ✨

These projects gave me hands-on experience with fundamental concepts in C#.
